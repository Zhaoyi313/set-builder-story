When the alien said to me:" take me to your leader". I replied...
"Trust me, you don't want to meet my leader." The Alien asked why and I replied
"Because, he's dumb, loud, and obnoxious."
"Wow!" The alien replied. "Sounds like you need someone new!" "You're 
telling me" I responded. 
"Well, what if I could make you look like your leader and you could 
replace him?" offered the alien. 
"Thats a great idea!" I exclaimed.
The second day, I believed I was the leader already, but I cannot make other people believe that. Because I did not use Twitter.
